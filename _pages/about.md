<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Researcher in the [Zhejiang University, Schoolof Software Technology](http://www.cst.zju.edu.cn/) <img src='./images/ZJU-Logo.png' style='width: 6em;'>. Before coming to ZJU, I worked at [Huawei, 2012 Lab](https://www.huawei.com/en/) <img src='./images/Huawei-Logo.wine.png' style='width: 5em;'> as a Senior Engineer. I graduated from Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University with a Ph.D. degreed. 

My research interests lie in system security, intrustion detection and cyber threat analysis techniques. I am now working towards to design practical intrusion detection and attack investigation systems. Currently I work closely with [Prof. Yan Chen](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ychen/) and [Xuhong Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhangxuhong)
